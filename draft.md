Product Draft: TrackEase Mobile Application
Product Name: TrackEase

Vision: To empower Malaysian micro and small business owners by providing a simple, accessible, and powerful mobile tool to digitize their core operations, reduce manual workload, and unlock data-driven growth.

Target Audience: Micro and small business owners in Malaysia who currently rely on manual methods like notebooks, spreadsheets, or chat applications to manage their business. Examples include roadside stall owners, home-based bakers, boutique sellers, and small service providers.

Core Functions (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
This is the foundational feature set designed to solve the most immediate problems.

1. Simple Onboarding & Setup
The first-time user experience will be quick and straightforward.

User Registration: Easy sign-up using a mobile number and a simple business profile creation (Business Name, Business Type).
Initial Inventory Setup: A guided process to add initial products or services. For each item, the user can input:
Item Name (e.g., "Nasi Lemak Biasa", "Tudung Bawal Cotton")
Price (in MYR)
Opening Quantity (the stock they have on hand)
(Optional) A photo of the item.
Customization:
Ability to categorize items (e.g., "Food," "Drinks," "Apparel").
Personalize basic information that can appear on receipts (e.g., a thank you note).
2. Daily Sales & Inventory Tracking
This is the core of the application, designed for fast, real-time transaction recording.

Simple Point-of-Sale (POS) Interface: A clean screen where the user can tap on items from their inventory to add them to a cart.
Automatic Inventory Update: Once a sale is confirmed, the stock quantity for the sold items is automatically deducted from the inventory.
Payment Method Logging: Record how the payment was made (e.g., Cash, DuitNow QR, Bank Transfer, or "Pay Later" for credit sales).
Digital Receipts: Generate a simple digital receipt for each transaction that can be easily shared with customers via WhatsApp, Telegram, or other messaging apps.
3. Basic Inventory Management
Users need a clear view of their stock to make informed decisions.

Inventory List: A simple view showing all items with their current stock levels.
Low Stock Alerts: The app will highlight items that are running low (based on a threshold set by the user) to prevent stockouts.
Manual Stock Adjustment: Easily add new stock or make corrections for damaged or returned goods.
4. Simple Payment & Customer Credit Tracking
To help businesses manage cash flow effectively.

Outstanding Payments List: A dedicated section to view all sales marked as "Pay Later."
Mark as Paid: Users can easily update the status of a credit sale once the payment is received.
5. Basic Dashboard & Reports
Provide at-a-glance insights into business performance.

Daily Summary: A simple dashboard showing today's total sales, number of transactions, and top-selling items.
Sales History: A calendar view to look back at sales figures for any given day, week, or month.

Expense Tracking: Allow users to log business expenses (e.g., raw material purchases, rent) to get a clearer picture of profitability.
Advanced Reporting: Generate simple profit & loss statements and more detailed sales reports.
Supplier Management: Keep a list of suppliers and track purchase orders.
